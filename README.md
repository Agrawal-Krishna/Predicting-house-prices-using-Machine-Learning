Predicting-house-prices-at-Austin-Texas using Visualizations, regression, and Machine Learning

#Project Objective/proposal: 

Our main aim is to make a model that can give us a good prediction of housing prices in Austin, TX based on different variables. We're going to use various analytics, visualizations, patterns, and clusters to identify the most important factors effecting housing prices. We will also look at yearly trends in price changes and the types of houses built via Dashboard visulization. Then we aim to predict the future price of houses at Texas based on house's feautures.

# Data Source: 

The dataset contains home listings containing housing prices and various housing attributes. These home listings were scraped from "Zillow.com" using their official API, via apify.com. This data was scraped on January 31st, 2021 and placed on Kaggle with following meta data. Meta Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericpierce/austinhousingprices/metadata

# Introduction & Motivation: 

When we look at housing prices on Zillow, two quick questions come into our mind. Whether prices shown on zillow are inflated or genuine? What is the general trend of housing prices in the city based on my preferred location and preferred housing attributes? We will answer these question through our models and dashboards and at the end we will ask you to fill the form with required information and we will predict a price for you. Also, this analysis can be used for property investments by real estate companies as well.

# Conclusion:

Visual tools shown earlier in this report allow for easier synthesizing of information, with these same types of algorithms expressed directly through Zillow's website. Companies such as Zillow likely utilize various forecasting and predictive modeling techniques to provide proper guestimates that inform consumers who are searching or selling. In this case, we found it unusual that so many of the variables had low correlation against Latest Price; this could have been due to multicollinearity, however, as there were numerous variables included in the dataset. Moving forward, this may be something we'd want to account for further by pruning some of the variables in such a way that reduces this issue. Many of the conclusions we derived from this report were intuitive - the number of bathrooms/bedrooms, the location of the home, and the overall square footage have an impact on the listing price and this makes sense given these are key features that consumers look for throughout the homebuying process.
